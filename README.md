# Tiko - Introduction
TiKo is a lightweight, asynchronous check-in system designed to help teams reduce or eliminate the need for daily standup meetings. It allows users to share daily Pulsesâ€”short, structured updates on what they're working on, blockers, and progressâ€”at their own pace, without the pressure of real-time meetings.
TiKo aims to improve team communication, boost individual accountability, and reduce meeting fatigue. It's especially useful for remote-first or hybrid teams looking for more flexible ways to stay aligned.
