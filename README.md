# tiko
TiKo is a lightweight, asynchronous check-in system designed to help teams reduce or eliminate the need for daily standup meetings. It allows users to share daily Pulses—short, structured updates on what they're working on, blockers, and progress—at their own pace, without the pressure of real-time meetings.
